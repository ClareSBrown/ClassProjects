A text based adventure game created in my Operating Systems Class.
On initialization, randomly generates rooms based on the number of 
rooms given and randomly connects the room in a bi-directional manner. 
Sets a starting room and an end room and places all the information for
each room in a .txt file for that room. When playing, presents player with
the ability to choose the next room that they want to go into. Counts the 
number of rooms until the player reaches the end and lists the path taken. 

To compile:
   gcc adventureGame.c -o adventure
